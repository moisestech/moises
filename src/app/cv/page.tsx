        {`Through affective computation, I use AI to explore memory, value, and meaning. I constantly learn from leaders in critical media studies, industry AI, and contemporary artists. My interdisciplinary practice is driven by my passion, mission, and profession for creative machine learning. Through research and visual communication, I desire to uncover where AI is growing in the human experience. Tools with embedded intelligence are a medium to paint different new philosophies around techno-poetics, AI politics, and what it means to be human.`}

Expressing recurring patterns that project our future and uncover our ancestral lineage allows me to become context-aware of our current moment toward a more ethical hereafter.`}
