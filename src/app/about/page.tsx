            <p className="w-1/2">
                Venezuelan-born, Miami-based Moises Sanabria is an interdisciplinary artist whose work extends dialectics of machine philosophy alongside trends in memetics and branding through the context of networked social-media life. Moises' work is philosophical and political, joining academic aesthetics with internet meme cultures. His practice is deeply entangled with digital newness, live-streaming, new media, machine learning, and installation to connect science advancement with art further.
