This work vividly captures the zeitgeist of our artificial mummified capitalist identity, exploring the commodification of intelligence and human data amidst the rise of neural capitalism.`}

These neural products, offered as services, become yet another micro-transaction in our everyday lives. Big Data, cloud computing, and GPU advancements scaffold a future where human and machine markets cohabit and further entangle, presenting a neural reality where personal data and matrix calculations are harvested for profit.`}

This scenario mourns the loss of our sacred inner worlds to profit, emblematic of Chris Harman's 'Zombie Capitalism' where consumption devoids life of meaning, only to have AI fill that void with hallucinations.`}

"Smart Shoppers" becomes a metaphor for the transactional nature of existence under capitalism, now expedited by technological advancements. Itâ€™s a critical inquiry into the sustainability of our consumer and technological trajectories, questioning the ethics of AI consumerism and neural capitalism.`}
